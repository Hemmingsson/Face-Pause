#### Look Away to Pause Youtube - Experimental Chrome Extension


Chrome (v56+) has a new FaceDetector API which basically lets you detect faces in images easily, so what if we could pause Youtube when you look away or going for a sandwich üçû?

Or Download the Zip from This [Release](https://github.com/Hemmingsson/Face-Pause/releases/tag/0.1), Unzip It and Load It as an Unpacked Extension in Chrome.

## Notice

- üôÄ I don‚Äôt trust my webcam, so I have it covered and I don‚Äôt trust Youtube/Google so see this more as an experiment of Chromes new technology, than a product you'd use every day. 
- üè¥ To get the extension to work you‚Äôll need to enable Chrome Experimental Features here: <br>
`chrome://flags#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`

- üí°If you‚Äôre in a dark setting it will probably be a bit buggy, as FaceDetector API is still not great in bad light.
