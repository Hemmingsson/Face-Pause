# Look Away
**Experimental Chrome Extension - Look Away to Pause Youtube**






I noticed Chrome (v56+) has a new FaceDetector API which basically lets you detect faces in images easily, so what if we could pause the youtube video you are watching when you look away or going to make a sandwich 🍞?

## Notice

- 🏴 To get the extension to work you’ll need to enable Chrome Experimental Features here: chrome://flags#enable-experimental-web-platform-features

- 💡If you’re in a dark setting it will probably be a bit buggy, as FaceDetector API is still not great in bad light.
